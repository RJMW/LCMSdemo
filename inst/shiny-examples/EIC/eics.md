### EIC
Extracted Ion Traces (EICs) show the ionic signal recorded along the chromatographic time for a selected m/z range. 
As discussed in the presentation, each detected metabolite will show *peaks*  in the EICs of its characteristic ionic signals. Unfortunately, the ionization of a metabolite results in a variable number of ions and this will become a challenge for the analysis of untargeted metabolomics dataset.

When starting the analysis of a specific dataset, it is always a good idea to spend some time inspecting the EICs looking for the peaks associated to metabolites known to be present in the samples under analysis. In the specific case of this demo, we are dealing with an apple extract analyzed in negative ion mode and a list of characteristic metabolites could include: *quercetin glucoside*, *quercetin galactoside*, *malic acid*, *procyanidin B2*, *quercetin* . So try to look for the EICs for their characteristic ions ... but how can one find them?

If you do not have any idea, a good starting point is to look for the monoisotopic mass of these molecules in [www.chemspider.com](http://www.chemspider.com/) ... and then to try to figure out which ion these molecules will produce ...

Some questios to orient the discussion ...

* What is the meaning of the figure?
* Whith the default values I see two peaks. Why?
* What whill happens if you change the parameters? Why?
