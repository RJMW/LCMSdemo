### Retention time correction
When analyzing a sequence of samples it is common (and unavoidable) to register retention time shifts. To construct the final data matrix it is necessary to efficiently correct for those shifts. 

The objective of this demo is to illustrate how "density based" retention time correction works. In order to interpret the plots, just remember that here we are processing the data obtained analyzing 10 apple extract by UPLC.

Some question to orient your discussion ...

* What is the meaning of the plot?
* What do the black (and blue) lines represent?
* What happens if you tweak the parameters?
* How can one select the optimal settings?
* Can you propose a strategy to find the best solution?
