### Retention time correction
When analyzing a sequence of samples it is common (and unavoidable) to register retention time shifts. To construct the final data matrix it is necessary to efficiently correct for those shifts. 

The objective of this demo is to illustrate how "density based" retention time correction works. In order to interpret the plots, just remember that here we are processing the data obtained analyzing 10 apple extract by UPLC.

Some question to orient your discussion ...

* What is the meaning of the plot?
* What do the spots in the map represent?
* What is the relation between the matrix and the TIC?
* What will happen if you change step size? Why?
* Can you pick a reasonable value for the step? How can you chose it?
