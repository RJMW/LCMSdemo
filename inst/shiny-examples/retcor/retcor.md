### Retention time correction
When analyzing a sequence of samples it is common (and unavoidable) to register retention time shifts. To construct the final data matrix it is necessary to efficiently correct for those shifts. 

The objective of this demo is to illustrate how "density based" retention time correction works. In order to interpret the plots, just remember that here we are processing the data obtained analyzing 10 apple extract by UPLC.

Some question to orient your discussion ...

* What is the meaning of the plot?
* What is the meaning of the black lines? ... and the one of the blue vertical segments?
* Is the retention time correction acceptable?
* Which is the effect of the different parameters?
* Which aspects should be taken into account to identify an optimal solution?
