### Profile Matrix
The profile matrix gives a two dimensional global representation of the raw signal recorded by the mass spectrometer for each one of the samples.

As discussed in the presentation, even with extreme high accuracy the m/z signal recorded by the spectrometer will slightly swing over time. To account for this small effect it is possible to rely on **binning** of the m/z scale. Narrower bins will give a more detailed representation of the true signal, but a bigger profile matrix is the price to pay for this higher level of detail
