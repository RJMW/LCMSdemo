### Peak picking
Running the `ExMF()` and the `ExCW()` demos running on the terminal, we should have now a clearer idea about what is the meaning of *peak picking* in xcms. 

This demo shows the position of the picked peaks on the profile matrix. Navigate the tabs and tweak the parameters and look how the picture is changing. 

Some question to orient your discussion ...

* Are you surprised that the two algorithms are finding the peaks in different positions?
* Are the parameters affecting the results as you would expect?
* Which is the 'best' solution?
* Which aspects should be taken into account to identify the best solution (in terms of algorithms and parameters)?
* Can you propose a strategy to find the optimal solution?
