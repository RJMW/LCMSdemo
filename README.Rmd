Demo for the EBI metabolomics course. The package is designed to provide an interactive (and gentle) introduction to xcms. The majority of the demos is provided in form of `shiny` web applications, which rely on `plotly` to perform interactive plotting.


# Installation

# Usage

The demo covers some of the key step in the preprocessing of untargeted metabolomics data by `xcms`.
The demo is not designe to be exhaustive, but it wants to highlight some of the ctucial points, focussing on the impact of some of the tunable parameters on the overall results. Even if it is clearly `xcms` oriented, many of the concepts and ideas are implemented behind the scees of many commercial closed source software solutions. 

The step covered in the demo include:

* Visualization and inspection of the raw LC-MS data
* Peak picking
* Grouping and Retention time alignment


#### Dataset
The data used for the demo are the results of a UPLC-QTOF(-) analysis of a set of apple extracts. The raw data and the description of the samples are availble @Metabolights (MTBLS59). Preprocessed data matrices are also included in the `BioMark` R package available @CRAN

### Viaualization of the Raw Data
Each raw file (cdf,mzXML) contains the data recorded by the mass spectrometer during the analysis of **one** sample. The data are two dimensional in nature and it is always a good idea to get a feeling on their properties looking at them. 

#### Profile Matrix 
The profile matrix gives a two dimensional global overview of the raw data. In `xcms` the profile matrix is constructed by binning the spectrometer data along the m/z dimension. The size of the bins will have a strong impact on dimension of the profile matrix, with possible consequencies on the speed of the overall data preprocessing.
In the RStudio console the specific demo con be run with

```{r}
shinyExample('profmat')
```

To stop the web based demo just close the window.

#### Extracted Ion Traces
As a general rule, the ionization of each metabolite will result in several ions (fragments, isotopes, adducts) and the "chromatographic" profile of each one of them will show a peak in correpondence of the elution time of the metabolite. These ion specific chromatographic profiles are called Extracted Ion Chromatograms/Traces (EIC/EIT) and they play a pivotal role in many preprocessing algorithm. In the ideal case the show a clean gaussian profile in correspondence of the meabolite peaks, but, unfortunately, many real-life profiles are far of being regular. This costitutes a clear challenge for any auomatic data analysis algorithm.

The package contains a shiny damo to visualize and inspect EICs. 

```{r}
shinyExample('eic')
```

To stop the web based demo just close the window.

### Peak Picking
With "peak picking" one refers to the process of spotting in the two dimensional rt/mz plane the "true" ionic signals, which are associated to the different metabolites. As we have just said, each detected metabolites generates at least one ionic peak in the signal space and being able of automatically (and reliably) finding those peaks is the first step for a successfull data analysis.

Peak picking can be performed in many differnt ways, and the literature pullulates of different peak picking algorithms. Above specific technical details, here we would like to highlight two important messages:

* Every algorithm has its specific pros and cons. There are not "perfect" solutions, but only better ones.
* To get the maximum from each algorithm it would be better to know which idea has been implemented behind the scenes, in order to  be able to adjust knowingly the algorithm (hidden) parameters.
* Every automatic solution will be less good than the analyst eye ... but the results will be repeatable. Do not ask perfection, only look for it ;-) ! 

In the package we implemented two interactive demos to show how `xcms` performs peack picking, by using two different algorithms `Matched Filter` and `CentWave`. The phylosophy of the two approaches has been covered in the lecture and further details can be found in the relative publications. In the demos we are touching the effects of a selected set of parameters, if you want to see more please refer to the `xcms` documentation.

The two peak picking demo are not implemented as Shiny applications but will run into the console and the plot will be shown in the standard R output. If you use "plane" R, the output will be an independent window, if you rely on RStudio (what we recommend) the plots will show up in the "plots" tab of the lower bottom panel of the application.

Both demos will show the progress of peak picking and each step will generate a new plot in the window. Waitig until the end of the process for a single file can be rather time consuming
